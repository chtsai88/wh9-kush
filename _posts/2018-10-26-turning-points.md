In this article, I will be exploring some of the key turning points in the history of the Kush empire. The first major turning point in the history of Kush occurs around the time 700 BCE in the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Lybian dynasty was in power at the time and was under threat by a rival dynasty rising from Leontopolis. In 751 BCE the Kushites invaded Egypt under the rule of king Piankhi and gained control of ancient Egypt. Archeologists have found texts that show king Piankhi invaded Egypt because “Amun of Napata granted me to be the ruler of every foreign country,”. The Kushites would go on to form Egypt’s 25th dynasty and rule from their capital, Napata, for the next 80 years.

The next key turning point is the invasion of Kushite controlled Egypt by the Assyrians. In 671 BCE the Assyrian empire conquered Egypt and drove the Kushites out. The Kushites where then forced to seek safety by moving their capital to Meroe. After relocating to Meroe the Kush empire had it’s golden age in the years to come, largely due to bountiful natural resources found in Meroe. With every peak, there must come a decline and this will be the next key turning point in the Kush empire.

Around 350 CE the Kush empire was in a state of decline, this was due to poor farming practices such as widespread deforestation, overfeeding of cattle, and overuse of farming soil. Due to this decline, the Kush empire was ready to collapse at any moment, but before the Kush empire could fade into oblivion, the Aksum empire conquered Kush. This brought the end of the Kush empire.

Key terms:

Napata: The first capital of the Kush empire and the capital that the Kushites ruled from during the 25th dynasty of ancient Egypt. 

Lybians: This was the dynasty that was in power before the Kushites invaded ancient Egypt.

Piankhi: The Kushite king who facilitated the conquering of ancient Egypt.

Meroe: This is the capital that the Kushites relocated to after being invaded by the Assyrians. The golden age of the Kush empire also occurred here.

Aksum: The Aksum empire caused the downfall of the Kush empire, they conquered Moroe during a period of economic distress.
