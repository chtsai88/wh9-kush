## Legacy of the kush empire

The Kushites did not have a large legacy that is very apparent in everyday life, such as the legacy of Rome and China, but in this article, I will highlight some of the less noticeable impacts the Kush empire left on the world.

- Iron technology
The Kushites greatly popularized the use of iron in weapons and tools and served as a global center for state of the art ironworking techniques. Without the Kush empire, other civilizations such as Rome and Egypt may not have grown so advanced due to the aid of iron tools.

- Gold
The Kush empire was also well known as an abundant source of gold, they traded gold with many empires and thus helped make those empires more powerful and wealthy. Egypt was one of Kushâ€™s main destination of gold exports.

- Slaves
Later in the history of the Kush empire, the Kushites became a large exporter of slaves. The Kushites supplied many slaves to other civilizations.
