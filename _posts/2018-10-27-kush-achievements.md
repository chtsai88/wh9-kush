				<li>The Kush empire was largely similar to the Egyptian empire in their culture, buildings, government, and religion. This being said, some Kush rulers made it their mission to differentiate the Kush empire from the empire of Egypt. In this short article, I will outline some of the key achievements that were unique to the Kush empire.</li>

				<li>Firstly, one of the main achievements of the Kush empire is that they were able to create one of the wealthiest economies of the ancient era. Via trade of iron weapons, iron tools, grains, and livestock, the Kush empire was largely acclaimed to be one of the largest centers of trade in that time period. Furthermore, due to its location near the Nile river valley, the Kush empire had bountiful natural resources to exploit.</li>

				<li>The second achievement on this list is similar to Egyptian culture, but a remarkable achievement that can only be obtained by a wealthy and powerful empire none the less. I am of course referring to the tall, flat-topped pyramids that are signature of Kush architecture. There are currently over 350 these pyramids that have been identified in the area that the Kush empire was located, each being roughly â…• the size of the pyramids of the new kingdom of Egypt and up to 30 meters tall.</li>

				<li>The third achievement I would like to talk about is their own system of writing, Meroitic script. The Meroitic script was originally developed under the rule of Arkamani I as a way to differentiate Kush from Egyptian culture. Although this system of writing is similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics, it has yet to be deciphered. Meroitic has both cursive and hieroglyphic forms, for general writing and governmental texts, and has a 23 letter alphabet.</li>

				<li>The fourth achievement on this list is irrigation, irrigation was essential for the success of the Kush empire as it provided the water for the large fields of crops and forests surrounding the city of Meroe. Irrigation was nessesary to provide water for the trees used to create charcoal, and for the crops to feed the city. The Kush people harness the power of the Nile to reroute water in irrigation channels to irrigate the surrounding area.</li>
