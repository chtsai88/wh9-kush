				<li>The Kush empire was largely similar to the Egyptian empire in their culture, buildings, government, and religion. This being said, some Kush rulers made it their mission to differentiate the Kush empire from the empire of Egypt. In this short article, I will outline some of the key achievements that were unique to the Kush empire.</li>


				<li>Firstly, one of the main achievements of the Kush empire is that they were able to create one of the wealthiest economies of the ancient era. Via trade of iron weapons, iron tools, grains, and livestock, the Kush empire was largely acclaimed to be one of the largest centers of trade in that time period. Furthermore, due to its location near the Nile river valley, the Kush empire had bountiful natural resources to exploit.</li>


				<li>The second achievement on this list is similar to Egyptian culture, but a remarkable achievement that can only be obtained by a wealthy and powerful empire none the less. I am of course referring to the tall, flat-topped pyramids that are signature of Kush architecture. There are currently over 350 these pyramids that have been identified in the area that the Kush empire was located, each being roughly â…• the size of the pyramids of the new kingdom of Egypt and up to 30 meters tall.</li>


				<li>The third achievement I would like to talk about is their own system of writing, Meroitic script. The Meroitic script was originally developed under the rule of Arkamani I as a way to differentiate Kush from Egyptian culture. Although this system of writing is similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics, it has yet to be deciphered. Meroitic has both cursive and hieroglyphic forms, for general writting and governmental texts, and has a 23 letter alphabet.</li>
