									<h2><a href="#">a general overview of the Kush empire.</a></h2>
									<p>The Kush empire, also called Nubia, was an empire that thrived in the lower section of the Nile river from 2000 BCE to 350 CE, coexisting with the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Kush empire largely focused on trade due to large deposits of iron ore located in the land of the Kushites. Kush culture was largely affected by the Egyptians due to their proximity.</p>

                <p>In the early ages of the Kush empire, the Egyptian empire largely held control over Kush, this caused to Kushites to be heavily influenced by Egyptian culture, as evident in the Kushite’s pyramids, religion, and government. After more than 1,000 years of Egyptian rule, the Kushites took advantage of political turmoil in 751 BCE to overthrow the Egyptian empire, king Piankhi was ruling kush at this time and is one of the most widely known Kush rulers. During this period the Kushites formed Egypt’s 25th dynasty, during this time period the Kushites expanded the borders of Egypt, moved the capital of the empire to Memphis, and built monuments. The Kushite rule of Egypt was short-lived, and in only 80 years the Kushites were overthrown by the Assyrians.</p>
								<p>After being overthrown by the Assyrian empire, the Kushites moved their capital to Meroe, were the golden age of the Kush empire occurred. The Kush people soon discovered large amounts of iron ore within their territory, this allowed the Kushites to create iron weapons and tools that gave them a great advantage over other empires. During the golden age of the Kush empire, the Kushites flourished by trading iron for goods such as jewelry, lamps, and cloth.</p>
								
								<p>The great success of the Kush empire via their economy also turned out to cause their decline. Due to a combination of poor soil quality due to over farming the land, overfeeding cattle, and deforestation due to the amount of charcoal needed for iron smelting, the Kush economy was greatly weakened around 350 CE. The Aksum people took advantage of the Kushite’s economic distress and was able to invade the Kushite empire without much resistance.</p>
